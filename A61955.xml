         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The De≈øcription and Cure of the <hi>Kenti≈øh,</hi> and all other Agues.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AGues</hi> are of two ≈øorts; Cureable or Uncurable. The Curable are tho≈øe that come in a common way of Providence: and all Per≈øons and Degrees of Men are equally lyable to the ≈øame; and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thus di≈øtingui≈øhed; <hi>A Quotidian,</hi> or every day Ague: <hi>A Tertian,</hi> or every other day Ague: <hi>A Quartan,</hi> or every third day Ague: Computing the time or di≈øtance of the Fitts right, will ≈øupply that ≈øeeming defect that is in the Terms.</p>
            <p>Every of which <hi>Agues</hi> have therefore divi≈øions; as Ligitimate, or Illigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, Simple, Double, or Triple; which cau≈øeth ≈øome more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficulty, rightly to di≈øcern between a <hi>≈øimple Quotidian;</hi> a <hi>double Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and a <hi>triple Quartan;</hi> each coming every day, and that very near alike: But the diligent Ob≈øerver of Time, and ≈øome particular Symptoms may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding ea≈øily gue≈øs.</p>
            <p>The Uncurable I reckon are tho≈øe that are not ≈øent in a common way of Providence, but more immediately from God in the way of ≈øpecial Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ≈øuch as <hi>I≈ørael</hi> of old were threatned withal, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.16. and they admit of no Phy≈øical Cure, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.22. but are like the ungodly King <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams</hi> Di≈øea≈øe of his Bowels, which will certainly de≈øtroy: Notwith≈øtanding the wi≈øe≈øt of men be concerned, and the very be≈øt of means be u≈øed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.18, 19. Some ≈øuch <hi>Agues</hi> I have ≈øeen in my time, which ≈øurely are no other then the fruit of ≈øin, which becau≈øe it di≈øplea≈øed God, and brings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil upon our ≈øelves: Let us take the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øts</hi> advice, and <hi>≈øtand in awe and ≈øin not; P≈øal.</hi> 4.4. But it is the former ≈øort of <hi>Agues, viz.</hi> Tho≈øe that are Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Phy≈øical Admini≈øtrations that I concern my ≈øelf herewith, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever others may think or believe, I am of that faith, that all di≈øea≈øes (co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not as afore≈øaid) are cureable. Only ob≈øerve, as formerly I have hinted el≈øewhere, That although I do believe that all Di≈øea≈øes what≈øoever are Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,, yet they are not Curable in all Per≈øons. My bu≈øine≈øs herein is to do two things; Fir≈øt to di≈øcover to you what an <hi>Ague</hi> is: And, Secondly, To di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how it is to be Cured: In both I will be plain and brief, and (yet I hope home, and full) to your content and ≈øatisfaction.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37817:4"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, we ≈øhall enquire what an <hi>Ague</hi> is; Many are the Opinions of all ≈øorts of Per≈øons concerning <hi>Agues:</hi> Some think it a ≈øtrange thing, but they know not what: The more ignorant, and evil Spirit; but coming they know not whence.</p>
            <p>Phy≈øicians them≈øelves differ in their Judgments concerning this Di≈øea≈øe, as well as in the way of Cure; my Task is ≈øo much the harder; however we ≈øhall declare our Apprehen≈øions, and leave it with ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and believing that there are ≈øome that are able to ≈øay more; other ≈øome as much, and other ≈øome not ≈øo much; to the latter of which as I intend this mo≈øt chiefly: ≈øo it will find mo≈øt welcome.</p>
            <p>But our an≈øwer to the above enquiry is; that an Ague is no other then an Intermiting Feavour, and every Intermiting Feavour is commonly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called an Ague, which doth ari≈øe from putrefaction of rotten humors.</p>
            <p>And its to be ob≈øerved that tho≈øe putrifying humours do rot either within the Ve≈ø≈øels, or el≈øe without the Ve≈ø≈øels, when they rot within the Ve≈ø≈øels, either all the humours do putrifie and rot equally, and cau≈øe <hi>Synochus Putrida.</hi>

            <p>Or el≈øe our only humour putrifieth and ≈øo cau≈øeth a common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry continual Feaver, and according as the humour is that putrifieth, ≈øo is the Feaver either a continual <hi>Quotidian</hi> or a continual <hi>Tertian,</hi> or a continual <hi>Quartan.</hi> But tho≈øe homours rot al≈øo without the Ve≈ø≈øels, and as from the putrefaction within Springs continual: ≈øo from the putrifaction without, comes intermiting Feavours, or Agues: coming upon the per≈øon ≈øooner or later, according as the humour is that putrifieth. For the Spirits ri≈øeth up at certain times &amp; oppo≈øeth that rottenne≈øs with heat, as an Enemy to Nature, and at the end of the combat returns home and according as the enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains either in ≈øtrength or vigor, ≈øo more or le≈øs good or evil Symptomes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: And if the putrifying humor be flegm, then the Spirits return to oppo≈øe it the very next day, hence the <hi>Quotidian,</hi> or every day Ague.</p>
            <p>And if the putrifying humor be Choller, then the Spirits return ≈øtill to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it every other day; hence the <hi>Tertian</hi> or every other day Ague.</p>
            <p>And if the putrifying humor be Melancholly, then the Spirits return to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it every third day, hence the <hi>Quartan</hi> or every third day Ague.</p>
            <p>The cau≈øe of the inequallity, that is to ≈øay: why one returns ≈øooner then another, why one comes every day; another every other day; and another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very third day is, Becau≈øe the Flegmatick humor recollects it ≈øelf ≈øooner, and ≈øo makes new work for the Spirits, and ≈øo its returns are accordingly. Choller which is accounted hot of it ≈øelf in re≈øpects of the Spirits oppo≈øing it with heat, doth occa≈øion a very hot combat and doth not ≈øo ≈øoon recollect it ≈øelf as the former: and therefore is oppo≈øed but every other day.</p>
            <p>Melancholly is a Dregy humor, and doth not recollect or recruit it ≈øelf as ≈øoon as the others do, but becau≈øe it is ≈øoft and vi≈øcous (the ≈øeat of which al≈øo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37817:4"/>being more remote) it is not ≈øo ea≈øie to overcome; notwith≈øtanding it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed every third day: And all the≈øe are changed one into another, or one joined with another, according as one while one putrifying humor, another while another is to be oppo≈øed.</p>
            <p>This is the mo≈øt common and general opinion concerning Agues: which I mu≈øt Imbrace and not condemn, there being much of Rea≈øon and truth in it rightly under≈øtood; and al≈øo becau≈øe it ≈øtandeth upon the ≈øhoulders of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned men: which is ≈øufficient Authority for ≈øuch a beleif.</p>
            <p>Neverthele≈øs I beg leave with humble ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, further to offer my late and more private conceptions concerning this thing, and hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I ≈øhall offend none: but rather prove, as a whete≈øtone to a knife, to beget an edge upon ≈øome more Great and Learned then my ≈øelf; to further enlarge this ≈øecret, and bring more light into the World, in re≈øpect to the Original cau≈øe (≈øetting ≈øin a≈øide) of all and every Di≈øea≈øe in Mans body; and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially and perticularly of an Ague concerning which; I have as to its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription a little more to ≈øay.</p>
            <p>Under≈øtand then with me, that every Di≈øea≈øe is admitted to be a being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øting in us, and not from crudities ari≈øing from things taken from without us.</p>
            <p>And then I judge an intermitting Feaver or Ague to be; The <hi>Archeus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, di≈øturbed, confu≈øed or di≈øthrowned by Ideas, conceived or inplanted in him, by a formative power: the <hi>Archeus</hi> him≈øelf according to the diver≈øities of his motion, ≈øtirring up ≈øundry and various Symptomes: For to me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly that every Ague is cau≈øed from the violent a≈ø≈øaulting Spirit, by Ideas conceived in the proper of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> by who≈øe fault alone, a living body ≈øuffers all di≈øea≈øes; and hence it is that many times ≈øpecifical Medicines excel in the curing the mo≈øt de≈øperate Agues. And hence it is al≈øo that the Ague begins with cold, becau≈øe the Spirits being to enter combat with a ≈øtrong E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, gather from every part aid; the outward member in the mean while Quaking; for the truth is, this Spirit is the Prince of the World in us, and hath alone obtained a motive beginning in us; as well Local as Alterative; containing the cau≈øe of rigor or extremity of cold, as well in re≈øpect of Local motion, as the Alteration of cold to ≈øucce≈ø≈øive heat.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Archeus</hi> or Spirit, intending by trembling rigors, As a Learned Man ob≈øerves, to ≈øhake off the excrements adhering to the Similer parts, and to quit it ≈øelf from a forraign gue≈øs. If this may contribute to further the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding of any concerning an Ague, and excite them to a further manife≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this way: I ≈øhall be truly glad, however I have ≈øpake my pre≈øent Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hentions, and at pre≈øent mu≈øt leave it to your Con≈øiderations, hoping that what may be found wanting to your content in the one, may be made up in the other: for this is all we have to offer at pre≈øent as to the fir≈øt thing, the De≈øcirption of an Ague; and ≈øo ≈øhall pa≈øs to the next which is,</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37817:5"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Cure of an Ague.</hi> There are ≈øeveral (ways propounded and at this day in practi≈øe to cure Agues, by the learned and Juditions which the common and vulgar people have confu≈øedly jumbled together, and ≈øo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øe the ≈øame Medicines in a <hi>Quotidian</hi> or every day Ague, as in a <hi>Tertian</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other day Ague, or in a <hi>Quartane</hi> or every third day Ague, having no re≈øpect to the nature, time or complication of the≈øe Di≈øea≈øes. My intentions herein are real and purely for the good of my Neighbours, whom I pitty when I ≈øee them quake and grone under the≈øe Di≈øtempers, and therefore ≈øhall indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour plainly to make known the cure thereof; ≈øo far as I judge them appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øive, and I have apprehended.</p>
            <p>I begin with a <hi>Quotidian</hi> Ague, which may be di≈øtingui≈øhed from a Double <hi>Tertian</hi> or a Triple <hi>Quartan,</hi> though they both come every day as a <hi>Quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> by its comming for the mo≈øt part in the night ≈øea≈øon, without ≈øhaking, and hath only a coldne≈øs or light ≈øhivering, and the heat and thir≈øt but ≈ømall.</p>
            <p>To cure this kind of Ague you mu≈øt ob≈øerve before the third fit to give or take a Vomit either of Infu≈øion of <hi>Crocus Metalorum,</hi> or a Do≈øe of <hi>Mercurius Vite,</hi> which in this ca≈øe is very excellent in ≈øtrong bodies; and be≈øure to give it at that time that is mo≈øt remote≈øt from the Fit: it matters not whether it be morning noon or afternoon; only let the ≈øtomach be empty of all food.</p>
            <p>And if the body be ≈øtrong, of evil habit and abounding with obnoctious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, if need be you may give it a ≈øecond time, otherwi≈øe once will ≈øerve.</p>
            <p>If the Ague go not away with this, then again≈øt the next fit following, prepare this decoction following, give it half an hour before the fit cometh and either walk roundly after it, or be covered warm upon the bed. Take Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil Flower and Wormwood of each a ≈ømall handful Juniper berries 100. brui≈øed, Cinamon 1 dram, boil all in a pint of White-Wine to half, ≈øtrain it and add 2 ounces of Sugar and drink it three days together if need be, one hour afore the fit cometh; and the Ague I ≈øu≈øpect may leave you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The cure of a Tertian or every other day Ague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give a vomit of the Infu≈øion <hi>Crocus Metalorum,</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore≈øaid on the well day, or 2 hours after the fit, and before the third fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and the next well day give this purge following. Take <hi>Electuary Diaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoricon</hi> one ounce, <hi>Cremor Tartar.</hi> 1 ≈øcruple, mix them and eat upon the point of a knife, drinking warm broath 3 hours after, forbearing to eat till noon.</p>
            <p>The next well day be let blood, if you be not to weak: and take away le≈øs or more according as it may offend either in quantity or quality, or is good or bad: If yet the fit remain then prepare, or cau≈øe to be prepared, one of the≈øe Specifical Medicines following, which ≈øeldom mi≈øs in curing, e≈øpecially coming after a general Evacuation of corrupt humours by tho≈øe Medicines afore≈øaid.</p>
            <p>Take of the Juice of Plantane 4 ounces, Ro≈øe Vinegar half an ounce Saffron 4 grains in pouder mix all together, and give it almo≈øt an hour before the fit.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37817:5"/>
            <p>Or, Give one Dram of the Pouder of the Herb called <hi>Cinquefoil,</hi> in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pint of Sack, in which is mixed 2 or 3 drops of Spirit of Saffron, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Cynamon, take it half an hour before the Fit comes. A≈øtrologers ≈øay, let <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peter</hi> be anguler and ≈øtrong when it is gathered, it being an Herb of that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. But I have ≈øeveral times proved the ≈øame with good ≈øucce≈øs: yet have ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no re≈øpect unto the times of gathering the ≈øame, becau≈øe God is ≈øtrong of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Power, the Trees, Herbs, and Seeds, in the Creation, was before the Sun, Moon, or Stars were Created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Or, Take Sal Ab≈øinthy, half a dram, Spiritus of Sulphoris Plampanum, one Scruple, Aqua Card. Benedictus. four Ounces.</p>
            <p>This I have often tried, and very ≈øeldom hath it failed in an≈øwering my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, either by way of Divertion, if not, of total Curation. Ob≈øerve after the taking of any of the≈øe three la≈øt mentioned Things; you mu≈øt take to your Bed, and be covered warm for four hours. You may renew the taking of them as often as you ≈øee cau≈øe, but u≈øually three times is ≈øufficient, except the Ague be very ≈øtubborn indeed, and al≈øo if the Body be ≈øtrong and can bear it; and full of bad Humour, and require it; you mu≈øt Vomit, and Purge as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid two or three times: Only ob≈øerve, that you mu≈øt do it in the fir≈øt place, and let the other Medicines ≈øucceed, and not the Vomit, or Purge; the other Medicines accept ≈øome other particular Indication thereunto: This rule being ob≈øerved, ≈øeldom will you mi≈øs of Cure in a <hi>Tartian,</hi> or every other dayes Ague, e≈øpecially if you begin time enough.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Cure of a Quartan, or every Third Day Ague.</hi> To Cure this ≈øort of Agues, are far more difficult than the two former, and that for ≈øeveral Rea≈øons before mentioned: For the≈øe Agues, e≈øpecially if they are not taken immediately, many times with≈øtand the ≈øtoute≈øt of ordinary Remedies: Therefore my Coun≈øel here again mu≈øt be, that you begin Cure before the third or fourth Fit at mo≈øt, and proceed thus. And fir≈øt, If the Body be bound, give an ordinary Gli≈øter over night, and the next day morning, being the well day, and that farthe≈øt from the fit, take this purging Potion following. Take Sene Alex. one ounce, Ray≈øons of the Sun half an ounce, Anni≈øeeds half a dram, White-wine ≈øix ounces, put tho≈øe things into the Wine, and ≈øet it into a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat, for five or ≈øix hours; then ≈øtrain it, and add half an ounce of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Rubarb, and drink it in a morning fa≈øting; drink a little Broth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as is u≈øual in taking Phi≈øick of that Nature. Next day four Ounces, about two hours before the fit comes; take one of the≈øe Vomits afore≈øaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infu≈øion of <hi>Crocus Metalorum,</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi> After which, upon the next well day, take the purging Potion afore≈øaid again: And ob≈øerve that one hour before the next fit after, to be let Blood in the left Hand, in the Vein between the Ring-finger, and the Little-finger: Which ≈øaid thing to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was done about ≈øixteen Years ago, by the Emprick <hi>Parker,</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37817:6"/>with very good ≈øucce≈øs, and to his great Honour, and worldly Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the Ague ≈øtill continue, then get ready this Specifical Medicines fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owing: Take Venice Treacle half a dram, Juce of Plantan a quarter of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>int, Saffron four grains, Sugar Candie one ounce, mix all together; and take he ≈øame one hour before the Fit cometh, being covered warm upon the Bed, do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>o three times together. If the Ague ≈øtill remain, then you may u≈øe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid Medicines over again once more; and if ≈øtill it ≈øhould remain, then there is certainly ≈øome more than ordinary fault in the Bowels; which to remove, you mu≈øt take this Medicine following fifteen Dayes together in the Morning fa≈øting, and drink warm Broth two hours after it, forbearing to eat till noon, and keeping within doors, but about the Hou≈øe you may go.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, it is ≈øo powerful a thing in ≈øtubborn <hi>Quartan Agues,</hi> that where ever I could per≈øwade any Patient to take the ≈øame, and ob≈øerve a good Diet, it ≈øeldom failed; and it is pure Love to my Neighbours, that cau≈øeth me to Incert it here. Take a quart of Burrage Water, one ounce of Sene Alex. half an ounce of the be≈øt Rhubarb, two drams of pure Salt of Tarter, and one dram of Oyl of Sulphoris Plampan. Put the Sene, Rhubarh, and Salt, into the Water together, then put in the Oyl of Sulpher, drop by drop, till it be all in; then ≈øet in an moderate heat for ≈øix hours, then ≈øtrain it, and divide it into four parts, and take one part every morning, as long as it la≈øt, as afore≈øaid; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king provi≈øion for more again≈øt that ≈øhall be done, and take hereof as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid: And there is no great Que≈øtion, if your Ingredients be good, and you punctual in taking, but you will (by Gods ble≈ø≈øing) ≈øind it to an≈øwer your Expectations, upon once more a little before the fit comes, taking the Specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicine as afore≈øaid, made of <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Many other Internal Medicines there are of all ≈øorts, and for all ≈øorts of Agues; but I mu≈øt Travel no further in this Field at this time, and that for much the rather, becau≈øe that I am ≈øatisfied that the≈øe related, are of as great Worth and Authority as any; except ≈øome particular <hi>Arcanaries,</hi> that may lie hid in the Studies, or Labrotaries of ≈øome particular Per≈øons: As al≈øo I do really believe, a good Diet being ob≈øerved, and Prayer and Supplication not omitted, the≈øe pre≈øent Medicines will prove very Succesful and Advantagious to all, and every Per≈øon, or Per≈øons that ≈øhall take the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>But be≈øides Internal, There are ≈øeveral External Medicines for Agues, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed and often u≈øed, and ≈øometimes with good ≈øucce≈øs (as I have been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) which way of Curation, though it be out of the Common way of my Practice, ≈øeeing no ≈øound Foundation for the ≈øame. Neverthele≈øs I cannot but have ≈øo much re≈øpect to them, knowing that God can do great things with ≈ømal means, if he plea≈øeth; as here to Incert the more Principal of them that I know of, and ≈øo leave Per≈øons to their Liberty in the u≈øing, or not u≈øing the ≈øame.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the other Vomit of Infu≈øion of <hi>Crocus Metalorum,</hi> is to be had at every <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> and the Do≈øe for Men is one ounce, with a little <hi>Oximel Simplex,</hi> mixed with it; for Women and Youth, ≈øix Drams; for Boys or Girls, about eight, nine, or ten years of Age, half an Ounce; for younger Children, from two Drams to three: and is a ≈øafe Medicine, and to be Drank in the morning fa≈øting: With the ≈øame Ob≈øervation afore≈øaid, or what is common in taking working Phy≈øick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Camphere,</hi> is to be u≈øed more or le≈øs, according as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is of ≈øtrength and years. Thus have I performed my fir≈øt two Promi≈øes, in di≈øcovering what an Ague is, and the Cure thereof; and I que≈øtion not, but herein I ≈øhall be profitable not only to my ≈øelf, but many others al≈øo. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will ≈øome be ready to ≈øay, that there is no Cure for an Ague, and that it will have its Cour≈øe, take what one will. To remove this ≈øtumbling Block, and to ≈øatisfie the Ingenious, according to my weak Capacity, I will here offer ≈øome of my pre≈øent Thoughts, how it comes to pa≈øs, that Agues are not often Cured. Know then, that the Rea≈øon is not becau≈øe they are Uncurable, for as I have el≈øewhere declared: I do believe that all Di≈øea≈øes what≈øoever are Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37817:7"/>though at all Times, nor in all Per≈øons. The rea≈øon then why ≈øo many are not Cured of Agues, e≈øpecially <hi>Third Day Agues,</hi> may be ≈øuch as the≈øe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe Per≈øons having E≈øpou≈øed the former Principal, that Agues are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, do not ≈øeek out for any other means, then their one or their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours judgment can advi≈øe to, until the Di≈øea≈øe hath rooted it ≈øelf in the Body, and the Putrifaction of the Humours and Blood great; that Nature is very much weakned, and the Di≈øea≈øe very much ≈øtrengthened, that no Ordinary means will do the Cure; whereas if they did apply them≈øelves to others more knowing, and that ≈øpeedily, before the fourth Fit at furthe≈øt, no que≈øtion but the Ague would ea≈øily be Cured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe many Per≈øons, if they do apply them≈øelves to a Phi≈øician in due time: Yet in re≈øpect of their quaint Stomachs, or peevi≈øh Fancies, they cannot take ≈øuch things as are proper for them, ≈øo that the Phi≈øician bending his mind to plea≈øe their Pallets, doth not oppo≈øe their Enemy with that Vigor, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as otherwi≈øe he by his Medicines might do: And whereas in this, many times the Patient blames the Phi≈øician for want of Cure, and indeed the Patient is more to be blamed, that they will not be Cured.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe others again, if they do leave the Phi≈øician to his Liberty in the former Re≈øpect; yet they will if a Friend tell them of a Medicine, and ≈øay its Rare, Jumble together the Medicine of their Friend and the Phi≈øicians, that the Efficacy, and powerful Opperation of the mo≈øt proper Medicines, are thereby very much hindred, and the Patient di≈øappointed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becau≈øe other ≈øome again: Notwith≈øtanding they give the Phi≈øician his due Liberty in making up what is needful, and ≈øtand by his Admini≈øtrations, and his only: Yet nedlecting them≈øelves at the fir≈øt, and ≈øo the Ague growing powerful, there mu≈øt of ne≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øity, not only more then ordinary means be u≈øed, but al≈øo longer time then ordinary required, and ≈øo they grow weary of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick; And if they be not Cured according to the time of them, or their Friends fancy, then away with the Doctor, and his Medicines; and make fal≈øe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion, that he cannot Cure him, when indeed it is the Patients one fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they cannot, or will not abide a Due and Regular cour≈øe. The≈øe things I know by Experience, and of many hereupon have run unto Drop≈øies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumptions, Black-Jaundies, and other de≈øperate Di≈øea≈øes, never to be Cured.</p>
            <p>Now then ≈øince ≈øo it happens many times, and that a more ≈øoon and ≈øpeedy Cure is de≈øired of all hands: I will propound a Medicine to tho≈øe that ≈øhall be willing and free to u≈øe the ≈øame, that ≈øure I am, that for the ≈øafe and ≈øpeedy Curing all ≈øorts of Agues (other means failing) that the like I know not extant. And this Medicine is, that noble Preparation <hi>Pul. Febrifuga,</hi> or the <hi>Ague Prighter:</hi> Of <hi>Riverious,</hi> as I am ≈øurely informed, the Preparation of which, as well as ≈øome of the Pouder it ≈øelf, is lately and Providentially come to my Hands (which I have often, as al≈øo many other Chyrugeons, and Phi≈øicians,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37817:8"/>which have had, and ≈øtill continue to have the ≈øame of me) Cured the very wor≈øt of Agues at three times taking at utmo≈øt: Only this ≈øhould be ob≈øerved, that the Patient take hereof before he is too much weakned, that they may be able comfortably to bear the Operation of the ≈øame, which di≈øcovers it ≈øelf in great Splendor, and Triumph in its Specifick Quality; be≈øides the largne≈øs of its Operation, as an <hi>Emetick, Cathartick,</hi> and <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> Medicine. And there is this Excellency in it be≈øides: That it hath no offen≈øive Ta≈øte nor Smell, Safe and Sure in its Opperation, and Cheap in Price; Three Do≈øes being not above five Shillings: and I never yet gave more in the mo≈øt Inveterate of the≈øe Di≈øea≈øes. Sometimes it Cures the very fir≈øt Do≈øe, oftentimes the ≈øecond, and what remains, may be kept without damage ten years, or till further Occa≈øion: And ≈øo ≈øometimes I have known three Patients Cured with three Do≈øes, many times with two, which is but Half a Crown a piece; and if it extend to the third, my Opinion is, that he that will not freely part with a Crown out of his Pocket, to be ea≈øed of ≈øuch a Di≈øea≈øe in his Body, de≈øerves to keep it.</p>
            <p>The Objection that I have met with in this ca≈øe is; but we are not ≈øure it will cure us. Our an≈øwer hath been and ≈øtill is: you are not ≈øure it will not, and that we dare not a≈øume Gods Prerogative to a≈ø≈øure that beyond our power, and are ≈øatisfied that le≈ø≈øer things then tho≈øe cannot nor dare not be warranted by any ≈øober Chri≈øtian, and therefore our a≈ø≈øurance can go no further then our experience, which in this ca≈øe, as in ≈øome others is very large, and that in re≈øpect to all ≈øorts of Sex, Ages and Con≈øtitutions what≈øoever: and for our further information herein we are under ≈øome obligation: not to Cumunicate the preparation, and therefore this preparation or Medicine is to be had of me, and me only at pre≈øent as afore≈øaid. And the truth is this pouder is not only thus excellent in Agues: but I have often experienced the ≈øame to be effectual in the curing of all ≈øorts of Drop≈øies, whether <hi>A≈øcities, Ana≈øarca,</hi> or <hi>Timpanies,</hi> and have ≈øeveral times known, that upon the taking once thereof: the patient hath voided in 6 hours time ≈øeveral gallons of water; by Seige and Urin to their great comfort, content and ≈øatisfaction. And al≈øo in that common and injurious Di≈øea≈øe called the Rickets, in children; and for the ≈øame I commend it as a thing highly to be prized and vallued by all ≈øuch, who for the good of there little ones ≈øhall have occa≈øion to u≈øe the ≈øame, having helped many therewith (by Gods ble≈ø≈øing) ≈øome of which being aged four, five, and ≈øix years, and could not go nor ≈øtand, but by the help of ≈øtilts.</p>
            <p>Likewi≈øe for all Inveterate pains of the Stomack or head ari≈øing from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Stomach occa≈øioning evil vapours to afflict the head or otherwi≈øe, this pouder is a ≈øure remedy being taken as ≈øhall be directed: The ≈øame al≈øo is excellent in the Gout, whether Podagra, Sciatica, or otherwi≈øe, and often times hath proved more then an ordinary help in that tetrible Di≈øea≈øe the Falling ≈øickne≈øs, if not of too long continuance.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37817:8"/>
            <p>Of me al≈øo is to be had, as occa≈øion may ≈øerve: The Element or Milk of Perl, which certainly cures (if taken timely enough) all ≈øorts of con≈øumptions of the body in all Ages Sex or Con≈øtitutions; only ≈øome ob≈øervations given therewith, in order to Diet, and compo≈øure of Mind.</p>
            <p>Al≈øo that excellent <hi>Pilulae Croci</hi> or the Saffron Pill, which certainly gives ≈øpeedy releif, if not cure in the mo≈øt de≈øperate and tormenting Di≈øea≈øes, the Stone, Inflamation or Ulcer in the Reines or Bladder; in extraordinary pains or Gripings of the Stomach or Bowels; as many have lately experienced, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al≈øo all Surfeits, Coughs, Colds Catarrhs, or other Flux of the belly, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Al≈øo <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> an antient and Noble Medicine, worthy of honor and e≈øteem among≈øt the able≈øt of Phi≈øitians, and to be wi≈øhed: prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as of old (but the <hi>Alkehe≈øt</hi>) who ≈øhall di≈øcover the middle way; mentioned by that expert Philo≈øopher, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>. H.</hi> I have practi≈øed ≈øome years, and find every time of Opperation by ≈øome perticular Ob≈øervations, that the Medicine may be much heightned in its vertue, or le≈øsned thereby; but being duly prepared, the place, Uten≈øils and Ingredients good, it is worthy of prai≈øe for the Curing all ≈øorts of worms in men women or children, for the curing all ob≈øtructions either of Liver Spleen, Me≈ø≈øentery or Womb, re≈øi≈øteth Melancholly potently, and is good: in Convul≈øion-fits, the Pal≈øie, and many other deplorable Di≈øea≈øes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al≈øo a good Cordial. Al≈øo <hi>Aurum Potabile;</hi> Not to deceive the World give it this title, to this <hi>Arcanum,</hi> therefore under≈øtand, that I do not avouch. Neither would I ≈øo be under≈øtood, as if I had attained to ≈øuch a Key as would unlock Gold and fetch ≈øuch a liquor therefrom as is the pure life and e≈ø≈øence thereof; and never to be reduced to the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance; But this I do affirm, that Providence hath made me ma≈øter of ≈øuch a Men≈øtrum (not Corro≈øive) as doth ≈øo kindly open the body thereof, that by it I produce ≈øuch a liquor, as I judge few or none are comparable to it, In all Di≈øea≈øes of the heart, for it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cures the pa≈ø≈øions, pains, beatings and weakne≈øs thereof, being a very rich Cordial, who≈øe operation be≈øides the comforting refre≈øhing and ≈øtrengthning, both Vital, Animal and Natural ≈øpirits: is very well plea≈øing to the <hi>Archeus:</hi> The principal director both as to health and ≈øickne≈øs; ≈øo that many by this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Medicine, have in a mannor been re≈øtored from death to life; e≈øpecially tho≈øe who have been under faintings, ≈øwooning or hycoughs. Al≈øo <hi>Ext. Magi≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> which is made and prepared of many choice Animals and Vegitables; yea and ≈øome of the Mineral Kingdom al≈øo; and is very profitable, and advantagious in the gentle and ≈øafe purging of the body of all obnoxtious humours, re≈øiding in the fir≈øt Region, or more Remote; and the truth is, my care herein hath not been ≈ømall, aiming to make it, as indeed I have done (vniver≈øal in its Cla≈ø≈øes) and therefore frees from, not only Chollor, but Flegm and Melancholly al≈øo; or from any Morbifick matter, that is or may be the cau≈øe of many Di≈øea≈øes; which I have had large experience of, upon my own body Spring and Fall, in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37817:9"/>order to the pre≈øervation of my health and welfare in that re≈øpect, for which I de≈øire to ble≈øs God. Al≈øo <hi>Tinctura Vita,</hi> or the <hi>Tincture of Life,</hi> which aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly helpeth lo≈øt Appetite, degenerated Di≈øge≈øtion, difficult Breathing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities of the Blood, conducing much to it's free circulation, inward Heats, &amp; Inflamation of what Part ≈øoever: and all evill I infermities in either of the parts of Di≈øge≈øtion: having al≈øo a peculier property to re≈øi≈øt the increa≈øe of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, &amp; many times alone cures the ≈øame. Al≈øo, ≈øeveral particuler and ≈øpecial Medicines proper only for tho≈øe Di≈øea≈øes incident to the Female Sex, of which mention is made by me, in my late Book <hi>(Mulierum Amicus)</hi> or, <hi>The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Friend.</hi> which have been largely experienced to the comfort of many in great difficult Times, of Di≈øtre≈øs, Trouble, and Danger; ≈øome of which I have always ready by me, and the other to be prepared in due time. Al≈øo, <hi>Aqua Opthalmi,</hi> which gives ≈øpeedy ea≈øe, and redre≈øs, in all Defluctions, Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or other Infirmities of the Eyes, and pre≈øerves and quickens the Sight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing u≈øed as ≈øhall be directed.
